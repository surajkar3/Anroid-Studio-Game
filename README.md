This is a basic tower defense game where you can buy towers with money and place them on the screen. There are enemies which do damage to the player and the player can move by touching the screen in the direction they want to move in. In order for enemies to lose health they must be in a certain proximity to a tower. If the player is in close proximity to enemies then the player will lose health. The game is over when the player loses all of their health.
